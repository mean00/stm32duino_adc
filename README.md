This is a more low level/complete version of the STM32DUINO adc management.
It enables :
* Single DMA capture
* Dual DMA capture
* Single DMA/timer capture
* Dual DMA/timer capture

It can be used either with STM2F1x or GD32Fyy chips depending if HIGH_SPEED_ADC is set or not.
/!\ It is meant to be used with my other repos : FreeRTOS and arduino_cmake_stm32
